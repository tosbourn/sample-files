## Description

This is a small repository of various files you can use for testing various things. It is forked from [tosbourn](https://github.com/tosbourn)'s [sample-files](https://github.com/tosbourn/sample-files).

I don't know about you, but I always end up needing test files for projects and I always
used throw-away files, it is about time I had a more consistent approach and a repository
of files to save time in the future.

## Add your own

You can add your own files to this list by forking the project, including a well named
sample file and adding a reference file to this README file.
