    <desc lang="en">Dominic Littlewood and Melinda Messenger meet Christophe and Debra Montoya-Timperley, who paid for an extension to their house in St Albans, Hertfordshire - only for the builder to vanish without a trace 12 weeks into the project, having not even dug any foundations. They were subsequently awarded Â£32,000 in a county court judgment, but could not track down the rogue tradesman to get their money back - so Dom sets a trap to lure him out of hiding. Meanwhile, Melinda and her team are faced with an intimidating workload as they try to finish the job the builder left behind.</desc>

    <title>The Big Painting Challenge</title>
    <sub-title>Still Life</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The amateur artists travel to Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, the birthplace and ancestral home of Winston Churchill. Their first challenge sees them arranging a collection of personal items - from a large yellow hat to a skull - which they must capture on canvas using acrylics. This is followed by a quick 30-minute sketch of a giant chess board, ensuring that light and shadow are just as important as perspective and scale. In their last chance to impress before the elimination, the hopefuls paint the facade of the palace, attempting to capture the drama of its stunning architecture, while Una talks to Churchill's granddaughter Emma Soames.</desc>

    <title>Match of the Day Live</title>
    <sub-title>Manchester United v Arsenal</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Manchester United v Arsenal (Kick-off 7.45pm). Gary Lineker presents coverage of the fourth FA Cup sixth-round tie, which comes from Old Trafford. Having overcome a trio of teams from the bottom two tiers of the Football League, the Red Devils now face their toughest opponents in the form of Premier League rivals Arsenal, who along with themselves hold the record for most number of FA Cup wins at 11 apiece. While United have drawn some criticism for their style of play recently, the Gunners are well-renowned for their free-flowing and attractive style, albeit with limited success over the last decade, with their victory in the final of this competition last season providing their first trophy in nine seasons. These sides have already met once in the league during this campaign, and it was United who claimed a 2-1 victory at Emirates Stadium on that occasion. This programme will also include the draw for the semi-finals, which are to be staged at Wembley Stadium next month.</desc>

    <title>Waterloo Road</title>
    <desc lang="en">After nine years of classroom drama, which has seen seven headteachers come and go and even a move from Rochdale to Greenock, the time has finally come to close the gates on Waterloo Road in the last-ever episode. But will the school be forced to merge with Havelock High or will it manage to remain independent? The decision day arrives, but with no Vaughan to lead them, the pupils are forced to take matters into their own hands - and soon discover the council is not being entirely honest about its plans. Meanwhile, Marco grows suspicious of Lorna's ex-husband, only for his meddling to put him and Kenzie in danger. Last in the series. This episode can be seen at 8.30pm on BBC3.</desc>

    <sub-title>Comic Relief - Face the Funny</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Red Nose Day returns with an evening of entertainment to raise money for disadvantaged people in the UK and Africa, and this year the fun comes live from the London Palladium. 7pm Lenny Henry and Davina McCall kick off the first hour of laughs, which includes Rowan Atkinson in a new Mr Bean sketch, guest starring Ben Miller and Rebecca Front. Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman pop in to announce the winner of The People's Strictly, after their performances on Wednesday night, and Dermot O'Leary finally gets the chance to sit down as his 24-hour dance marathon comes to an end. 8pm David Walliams joins Davina as co-host, and introduces a special Vicar of Dibley in which Geraldine (Dawn French) is up for the job of bishop - only to find she has some very famous competition. There's also music by Ella Henderson, highlights of Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights Live and an appearance by Mr Khan. 9pm Davina and John Bishop present a brand new Little Britain sketch featuring David Walliams as Lou and his new friend Professor Stephen Hawking. There's also a live sketch in which Eddie Izzard teams up with the hosts and a song from Sam Smith. Continues at 10.40pm. Times and details may vary.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Wales v Ireland (Kick-off 2.30pm). Gabby Logan presents coverage of the opening match in the fourth and penultimate round of fixtures, which takes place at Millennium Stadium. Wales lost their only previous home game in this year's championship, falling to a 21-16 defeat to England despite leading 16-8 at half-time. Warren Gatland's men will be eager to repay their passionate home crowd following that collapse, and having been subjected to a 26-3 loss to Ireland at Aviva Stadium last season, they may feel as though they have a score to settle. With commentary by Eddie Butler, Jonathan Davies and Phillip Matthews, and analysis from Keith Wood, Shane Williams and Martyn Williams.</desc>

    <sub-title>England v Scotland</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">England v Scotland (Kick-off 5.00pm). John Inverdale presents coverage of the match from Twickenham, which also sees the teams contest the Calcutta Cup, a trophy that was first competed for in 1879. The hosts will enter this fixture as the favourites for victory owing to their superior recent record in this fixture, having not lost to Scotland since 2008, and last having a home defeat inflicted on them in 1983. However, Vern Cotter's men have shown signs of improvement during this campaign, displaying plenty of gumption in narrow defeats away to France and at home to Wales, and they will be keen to claim a morale-boosting win. With commentary by Andrew Cotter and Brian Moore, analysis from Jeremy Guscott, Clive Woodward and Andy Nicol, and reports by Jill Douglas.</desc>

    <title>The Irish Rock Story: A Tale of Two Cities</title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary telling the story of how rock music helped bring about change for Ireland over 40 years, and how the sounds that emerged were grounded in the musical traditions of Ireland's two main cities. From the pioneering touring showbands of the late 1950s through to the modern day, the film examines how the harder sounds of Belfast merged with the more folk-centric traditions of Dublin, celebrates some of the key musicians to have emerged from the Irish scene, and reveals how they were influenced by the political, social and cultural climate of their surroundings. With contributions from U2, Sinead O'Connor and Bob Geldof.</desc>

    <title>Life After Suicide</title>
    <desc lang="en">The leading cause of death in men below 50 is suicide, yet people still seem reluctant to talk about it. Birkenhead woman Angela Samata, whose partner Mark took his own life 11 years ago, meets others who have suffered a similar loss, asking why some people choose to take their own lives and whether those left behind can ever come to terms with their bereavement. Those she meets include Downton Abbey actor David Robb, talking about the death of his actress wife Briony McRoberts in 2013, a Somerset farmer and his five young daughters, and a Norfolk woman who is living with the suicides of both her husband and son.</desc>

England have finished second in the standings for the last three years and there is every chance that they could do so once again following their defeat to Ireland in Dublin in their third fixture. Les Bleus have seldom provided a dynamic attacking threat this year, scoring just two tries in their first three matches as they struggle to find the right formula ahead of the World Cup, which gets under way in September and will be the next time these nations are involved in competitive action.
